Linear Regression is a statistical algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables. It is also a supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled datasets and maps the data points with the most optimized linear functions. It models the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variable by fitting a linear equation with observed data. 

Simplicity is one of the greatest strengths of linear regression-it displays clear coefficients which illustrate the influence of each independent variable on the dependent variable. 

Our primary objective with linear regression is to locate the line of best fit, which implies that the error between predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum.

Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is the independent or predictor of Y. X may be a single or multiple features.
